Ellieâ€™s Electric car (EEC) is rental company up until now they have been using spreadsheets in order to keep record of its vehicle rentals, as the company has been growing over the years with new branches and with a lot more vehicles than initially had, it is becoming a lot more difficult to keep record of what cars are on rent and what cars are available to rent. This problem is causing customers to complain an and even loss of business, therefore we have been tasked to develop a database that allows online bookings and avoid multiple booking of the same car. we are using MS SQL Server in developing of this project by designing and building a relational database, designing data warehouse and discuss any data security issues that might arise building this database.
